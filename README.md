## Requirements
- `python3.10` or above!
- `$ pip install -U aurivm` And, don't forget to install aurivm!
- `.env` file with API keys from your providers like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
-  Set an `.env` Variable with your desired workspace dir: `WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"` or do it in your terminal with `export WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"`
-  Finally, `aurivm onboarding` to get you started.

## Install üíª
Install the following packages with copy and paste

```bash
$ pip3 install -U aurivm aurivm-models aurivm-memory
```

## Onboarding

Now that you have downloaded aurivm with `pip3 install -U aurivm`, we get access to the `CLI`. Get Onboarded with CLI Now with:

```bash
aurivm onboarding
```

You can also run this command for help:

```bash
aurivm help
```

## `Agent` Class
The `Agent` class is a fundamental component of the Aurivm framework, designed to execute tasks autonomously. It fuses llms, tools and long-term memory capabilities to create a full stack agent. The `Agent` class is highly customizable, allowing for fine-grained control over its behavior and interactions.

### `run` Method
The `run` method is the primary entry point for executing tasks with an `Agent` instance. It accepts a task string as the main input task and processes it according to the agent's configuration. And, it can also accept an `img` parameter such as `img="image_filepath.png`
